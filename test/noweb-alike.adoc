.Other multiline chunk
[source]
----
nested one
nested two
----
and this is where it ends

.Multiline chunk
[source]
----
first line
second line <<Other multiline chunk>>
----
and this is some text
that ends here

noweb would escape the first @@ because it's at the beginning of the line,
but not the second. In our case, we should only do the beginning-of-the-line escaping
when working in noweb mode (i.e. when processing a block defined by using
`<<Chunk name>>=` _inside_ the block:

.With an at
[source]
----
@@ <- this is an at
and one @@ in the middle
----
and we continue

[source,output=adoc.result]

here we insert the <<Multiline chunk>> for testing,
here we insert the <<Other multiline chunk>> for testing twice <<Other multiline chunk>> and close,
here we escape @<<Multiline chunk>> on one side
here we escape <<Multiline chunk@>> on the other side, and this fails because there is no [Multiline chunk@] chunk
here we escape @<<Multiline chunk@>> on both sides
here we escape @@<<Multiline chunk>> the escape character
here we escape @@@<<Multiline chunk>> the escaped escape character
here we don't escape <<Multiline as it is not be needed
here we escape @<<Multiline though it would not be needed
